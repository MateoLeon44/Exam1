# Mongo Explorer
# JOHN: I CHOOSE THE FIRST OPTION, AND MY CREATIVE COMPONENTS ARE: LOADERS WHILE RETRIEVING DATA VIA FETCH, GETTING DATA FROM THE FIRST DB/COLLECTION IT FINDS, SHOW RETRIEVED OBJECTS AS JSON IN THE TABLE

https://mongoexplorer.herokuapp.com/

This project is aimed to explore the different databases, collections and documents that a connection has. The predetermined configuration is to run a Mongo Atlas db, however it works with other databases like the ones in localhost (be sure that the process is running though).

This project was created with plain Javascript, Node.js, MongoDb, express, HTML5, bootstrap, ajax (fetch api) and css.

## How to run the project locally
### As a prerequisite you need to have installed mongodb and npm with their respectives enviornment variables

1. Create a new folder
``` 
mkdir MongoExplorer
```
2. Go into the folder
```
cd MongoExplorer
```
3. Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/MateoLeon44/MongoExplorer.git
```
4. Enter the folder created (root of the project)
```
cd pathOfTheFolderCreated
```
5. Install npm dependencies (You need to have node.js installed globally with its respective enviornment variable included in path)
```
npm i
```
6. Run your mongod service (You need to have mongodb as a service installed with its respective enviornment variable included in path)
```
mongod --dbpath C:\data  (or your path where data is located, if you don't have one create one with mkdir C:\path and then run mongod --dbpath C:\path
```
7. In the root folder start the project with
```
nodemon (you can also run it with npm start)
```
8. Change the path of 'Conexi√≥n' to mongodb://localhost:27017 and click in 'Conectarse'
# How the project works

* The project runs in a MongoDB atlas database, so it will search for current dbs, collections and documents in the sample data created
* Then you can select if wheter you want to connect to a external db (for example another Mongo Atlas db) or run it  locally
![Choose wheter to connect or not](https://i.imgur.com/YEBRX3o.png "Connection")
* If the petitions are to an external db, a loader is going to pop up, until the data has been retrieved. THE LOADER WILL GO INFINITE MODE IF THE DB OR COLLECTION HAS NO DOCUMENTS (happens with local and admin dbs)
* After this, you can choose which database and which collection you want to see
![Select database and collection](https://i.imgur.com/Al5TDWL.png "Select db/col")
* You can then create a new element within the schema (model) of the LAST document retrieved
* The documents are limited to 20 documents since the sample data is too large and would make the table to load infinitely. Also, it shows the created order in desc order (the last item is the first in the table)

* Finally, you can see what documents are in the database and collection selected for that connection
